# Topo-ML
Use the .py to get the bettivectors and the .ipynb gets the accuracies and AUC 
specifically, in this case we run XGBoost, XGBoost with feature selection, and PyCaret on the Breast Cancer and Pneumonia data sets from MedMNIST. 
Although we are using higher resolution images, we achieved much higher accuracies and AUC values compared to the benchmark models as seen in the image below:
